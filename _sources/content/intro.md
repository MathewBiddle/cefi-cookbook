## CEFI information Hub
As part of the Operational Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Decision Support System, CEFI Information Hub's goal is to provide easy access to regional ocean model outputs (high spatial resolution reanalysis, hindcasts, predictions, and projections optimized for management applications), ecosystem projections and other information relevant to climate-informed resource management.

### NOAA CEFI Data Cookbook
As part of the effort of the information Hub, the CEFI data cookbook here is aiming to provide useful information, intruction, and code snippet to help researcher and general public on accessing the useful data/information that are used in many Climate, Ecosystems, and Fisheries studies and decision making processes.
