## CEFI information Hub
As part of the Operational Climate, Ocean, and Ecosystem Decision Support System, CEFI Information Hub's goal is to provide easy access to regional ocean model outputs (high spatial resolution reanalysis, hindcasts, predictions, and projections optimized for management applications), ecosystem projections and other information relevant to climate-informed resource management.

### NOAA CEFI DATA Cookbook
In conjunction with the Information Hub, CEFI DATA Cookbooks provide snippets of code, along with additional information and instructions, that can read CEFI-relevant data into programming languages, including python and R. The code can also be used to generate figures to ensure that the data is read in correctly.
